# Secrets Test

Sops-nix *can* work with MicroVMs.

## Overview

Secrets (with sops-nix and also others) are decrypted at activation, which is when the MicroVM boots.  The actual VM's config is created in a flake like this, which is where the secrets will be imported.  You must pass through the decryption mechanism, such as an age key, or enable access for cloud-based ones (I haven't used though, though).

Any mounted volume with keys should be marked as required for boot.  Sops-nix documentation does talk about this, these VMs are fundamentally impermenant.

## Requirements

* Import/mount keys
* Set them required for boot (like sops-nix documentation says about impermanence)
* Set the location of the keys to be used

## Using the VM's host keys

Externally provided keys will be required.  SSH keys that are not persisted *will* be regenerated by default due to `services.openssh.generateHostKeys` if SSH is enabled, or no keys at all will be present.
